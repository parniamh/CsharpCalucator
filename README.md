# 🧮 Csharp Calculator — My First Functional App in C#  
A beginner-friendly Windows Forms calculator built with C#  
Created during my journey into programming and event-driven logic ✨  

## 💡 What it does  
Click on number and operator buttons to build expressions,  
Then press "=" to calculate the result—plus square root and logarithm functions!  
This project helped me understand how buttons, conditions, and math work together in a user interface.  

## 🎯 Why it matters  
This was a major step in building functional, interactive software.  
It shows how user actions trigger different logic paths through event handling.  

## 🔧 Technologies used  
💻 Language: C#  
🖥️ Framework: Windows Forms  
🛠️ Environment: Visual Studio
